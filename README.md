<h1> Weasley's Wizard Wheezes Homepage </h1>

<a href="https://gh0start.github.io/WizardWheezes/">Live Demo</a>

This web page was created as part of a challenge project from <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>.

The project directions were to create a homepage for a company using flexbox for scalable content.

I created a home page for an online version of the fictional store Weasley's Wizard Wheezes featured in the Harry Potter series. I hope to futher
expand on this project by creating browsing and "purchasing" functionalitty to mimic an actual online store.
